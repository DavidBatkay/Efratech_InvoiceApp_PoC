# 🧾 Invoice Management App (PoC)

A full-stack **Invoice Management Web Application** developed as a **Proof of Concept** (PoC) for an apprenticeship opportunity. This project showcases my ability to build a complete CRUD application using modern web development tools, with features that cover real-world business needs like client management, invoicing, payments, filtering, and dashboard analytics.
